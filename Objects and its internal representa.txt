               Objects and its internal representation in Javascript

An object is a collection of properties, where each property is a key-value pair.

The syntax for adding a property to an object is :
         
    Key: value

To create an object for example:

Let student = {
          name: “Abc”
          rollno: 1
          std:5
}

• In the above example student is the object name.
• It has 3 keys name, rollno , std
• Objects keys have to be unique
• The key and value enclosed between { } open and close curly parentheses
• To get the value we should use . dot operator

Console.log(student.name);
Console.log(student.std);

The above codes will give the following output :

//Abc
//5
